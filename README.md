- Move: `ZQSD` (French keyboards)
- Move: `Arrows`

### Context

You control two characters: a black skeleton in a white dungeon and a white skeleton in a black dungeon.  
Moves of the white skeleton are mirrored to the black skeleton.

Each of the skeletons must reach an end area in the dungeon to progress to the next level.

You can interact with the elements that have the same color of the skeleton, it can have an impact in the other dungeon!  
You can switch the two views in order to see on the other side of the level.

## Synopsis

Are you alive ? Maybe yes, maybe no...  
You just wake up in the catacombs. How did you come here ?

Wow!

Let's go out of there!
